title: About
---
I'm Camille Merose, an enthusiast. 

Some things that are true:
- I spend a lot of time reading (link to my Goodreads in the footer).
- I'm a big food and drinks person.
- I'm married the love of my life <a href="https://alex.merose.com/">Alexander Merose</a>.
- In 2020, I graduated from Mills College's Interdisciplinary Computer Science program. The school has since been changed in big ways, so I can't really say what that program is like now.
- I'm a software engineer at [Earnest](https://www.earnest.com/).
- I love being outside, no matter forest or desert, hiking or kayaking. Cities have been growing on me, too!

The website is intended to be my home online. Its contents will reflect my interests and activities, so expect a mix of sustainable fashion, tech, travel, food and whatever else is on my mind.
