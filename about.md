I'm Camille Merz, a life enthusiast. I would normally have something to say about what I do for work and for fun, but I'm very interested in honesty and honestly, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown my career and hobbies for a loop.

Some things that are true, pandemic or not:
- I spend a lot of time reading
- I recently married the love of my life <a href="https://alexrosengarten.com/">Alexander Rosengarten</a>.
- Last year, I graduated from Mills College's Interdisciplinary Computer Science program. I'd recommend it to anybody and feel free to reach out if you're interested in it.
- On a super closely related note, I'm looking for a job as a software engineer. I'm a hard working gal who picks up new ideas fast. I'd love to hear from you if you're hiring!
- I love being outside, no matter forest or desert, hiking or kayaking.

The website is intended to be my home online. Its contents will reflect my interests, so expect a mix of sustainable fashion, tech, travel, food and my hot-n-spicy takes.
