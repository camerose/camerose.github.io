I'm Camille Merose, a life enthusiast. 

Some things that are true:
- I spend a lot of time reading (link to my Goodreads in the footer).
- I recently married the love of my life <a href="https://alex.merose.com/">Alexander Merose</a>.
- Last year, I graduated from Mills College's Interdisciplinary Computer Science program. I'd recommend it to anybody and feel free to reach out if you're interested in it.
- I'm a software engineer at [Earnest](https://www.earnest.com/).
- I love being outside, no matter forest or desert, hiking or kayaking.

The website is intended to be my home online. Its contents will reflect my interests, so expect a mix of sustainable fashion, tech, travel, food and my hot-n-spicy takes.
