I'm Camille Merose!

In October 2023, my husband <a href="https://alex.merose.com/">Al</a> and I quit our tech jobs to travel the world. We're having the time of our lives. If you want to follow along, we're writing about our travels on <a href="https://vagabonvivants.substack.com/">our Substack</a>.

<br>

We'll be back to tech eventually.
