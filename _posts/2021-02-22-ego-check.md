title: "Ego Check"

I've been really upping my efforts to get a job recently. I've joined [Outco](outco.io), an interview prep bootcamp, applied to tons of jobs, updated my resume and got my personal branding together. It's been working, and I now have interviews with some companies that I'm really excited about.

A couple of days ago I received a message in Indeed.com that began

> Hi, I came across your profile on Indeed and at first glance your experience seems to be a good fit for our current job opening.

Very exciting! Then I took a look at the job description and requirements.

It's the ego check I needed - I'll be applying to an extra ten jobs this week.
