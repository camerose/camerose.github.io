# An Argument for Country Music (A Playlist Designed to Change Your Mind)
My manager at my internship went to grad school in North Carolina, and has a pretty romantic view of living in the 
country. I wondered if I had managed to find another country music fan in the city, so I asked “Sreenu, do you like 
country music, or just country living?” His response was shockingly open-minded (an uncommon response to country music; 
most people are transparent about their hatred), so I jumped on the opportunity. My over-enthusiasm led to this - 
a playlist carefully curated to show the diversity, joy and sorrow that exists within an oft vilified (in California) 
genre. I present to you, An Argument for Country Music.
