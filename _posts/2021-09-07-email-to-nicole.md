An email I just wrote to my wedding planner began like this...
<br>
"Hi Nicole,
I have spent the last couple of days absolutely downing candy corn and just realized that I may have accidentally dressed our wedding party up as candy corn. If we're wearing yellow, orange and white are we going to look like candy corn? I am losing my mind."
