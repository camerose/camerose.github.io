## In Progress

Alex and I got engaged on February 7 and the shelter in place order went into effect on March 16. We tried to think about planning a wedding, but it quickly became clear that we had no idea when we'd be able to have a party with 200 of our closest friends and family. 

We generally knew that we wanted to be legally married by the end of the year, mostly for tax reasons
