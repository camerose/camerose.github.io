## In Progress

Alex and I got engaged on February 7 and the shelter in place order went into effect on March 16. We tried to think about planning a wedding, but it quickly became clear that we had no idea when we'd be able to have a party with 200 of our closest friends and family. 

We generally knew that we wanted to be legally married by the end of the year, but didn't make any moves towards making it happen until Thanksgiving dinner. Our families asked about details for our civil ceremony and we came up totally empty. Our immediate families are located from Marin County to San Diego, so we tried to make a plan for a small civil ceremony in Los Angeles. We quickly found the wonderful [1 Hour Marriage](https://www.1hourmarriage.com/) and set up a ceremony for December 12, 2020. We arranged a couple more details and were good to go!

The day after we finalized our last details, new COVID travel restrictions went into effect. 

We cried a little bit
