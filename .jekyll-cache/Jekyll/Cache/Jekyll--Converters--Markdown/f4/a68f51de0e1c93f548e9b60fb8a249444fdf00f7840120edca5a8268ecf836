I"ô<h1 id="women-in-tech-growing-your-career-networking-event-at-plaid-hq">Women in Tech: Growing Your Career (Networking Event at Plaid HQ)</h1>
<p>This week I attended a panel and networking event at Plaid HQ in San Francisco entitled ‚ÄúWomen in Tech: Growing Your 
Career‚Äù. I‚Äôve been trying to attend as many of these networking and career building events as possible this summer. I 
think the inclination comes partially from not wanting to get stuck in the fast turnover cycle that is so common for 
software engineers. People talk about how the average amount of time a software engineer stays at a company is 1.5 
years. While I wasn‚Äôt actually able to find data that backs that up (from a quick search), a <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/trends-and-research/2018/the-3-industries-with-the-highest-turnover-rates">13.2% annual turnover rate</a>
is similarly alarming. The interview process for engineering positions is notoriously grueling and drawn out, so it‚Äôs 
surprising that so many people are willing to go through it so often. Since I‚Äôm starting a little later than many people 
(26 and currently in my first internship), I‚Äôd like to expedite the process of finding a good fit for a full time 
position.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm doing a couple of things to move toward that goal (maybe another blog post on those efforts later), but I think one 
of the best so far is to attend panels like the one hosted at Plaid. The panel consisted of some truly 
incredible women with diversity in experience, positions and opinions. They were: Laura Del Beccaro, Co-Founder &amp; CEO 
at Sora, Evelyn Cordner, CTO at Storr, Ligia Frangello, Software Engineer at Plaid, Nitya Subramanian, Product Manager 
at Celo and moderated by Kate Adamson, Product Manager at Plaid. I try to ask engineers that I meet a ton of questions 
about how they choose roles and positions, and panels like this are a great way to do that (plus they usually have 
great food!).</p>

<p>Here are some of my big takeaways from the event:</p>

<p><strong>If there‚Äôs a decision that seems risky, consider whether or not the result is reversible. If it‚Äôs easily reversible, 
go for it. If the result is irreversible, give yourself some extra time to think.</strong></p>

<p>I think that this one really helps give me a framework of how to handle my chronic worry and overthinking. 
Most decisions are reversible! Laura gave the example of starting a company as the kind of thing that seems like a huge 
important decision that you could easily agonize over, but is essentially reversible. The culture in tech (at least in 
the bay) is one that worships founders, so you won‚Äôt be blacklisted for founding a company that doesn‚Äôt stick around. 
The ability to go back to engineering means that even starting a company is reversible.
The only missing piece in this idea is the time consumed in the process of making a decision and reversing it. Maybe this is 
partially because I‚Äôm still so early in my career and the late start, but time is a non-renewable resource and that 
causes me anxiety.</p>

<p><strong>Critically consider feedback before internalizing it.</strong></p>

<p>My experience in wilderness guiding has given me a lot to think about on the subject of feedback, so it‚Äôs good to apply 
those ideas to professional situations as well. We talk about both giving and receiving feedback strategically. I think 
that this lesson is particularly poignant for women in tech, who are likely to receive gendered feedback. One panelist 
got the feedback that she needs to smile more in the office (when she said that in the panel, there were disgusted 
faces and exclamations) and talked about her process of considering this feedback before internalizing it. I‚Äôve also 
received gendered feedback in a workplace (not exactly that I need to smile more, but a similar idea) and think that 
hearing this advice would have helped me protect my confidence and self-worth.</p>

<p><strong>When deciding whether you want to be in engineering, product or management, consider what you want to become an expert 
at.</strong></p>

<p>This a BIG one for me. I think a lot about whether I 
want to stay in pure engineering or if I would like to have more say in what products are made. Right now I have no say 
in what products are made, but of course that‚Äôs true since I‚Äôm an intern. I think that it would be really interesting 
work to think about the problems that customers are facing and what we could do to solve them. It also might be 
dependent on who your customers are. At LendUp, I feel incredibly sensitive to any problems that reach our customers 
and want there to be a strong sense of responsibility in the engineering team.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking about this issue is this: ‚ÄúWhose problems do you want to solve?‚Äù In product management, you‚Äôre 
solving the customer‚Äôs problems. In technical management, you‚Äôre solving the engineer‚Äôs problems. In engineering you‚Äôre 
solving abstract problems that belong to nobody and everybody. At some point, I‚Äôll need to decide whose problems I want 
to solve.</p>

<p><strong>Assemble An ‚ÄúI Deserve This‚Äù Book</strong></p>

<p>Putting together a collection of the positive feedback and accomplishments that you‚Äôve had throughout your career can 
be valuable when you‚Äôre in a tough position and need help pulling yourself out of it. No career will be free of 
disappointments, so there‚Äôs value in being prepared when they come.</p>

<p>Plaid, thank you so much for hosting this wonderful event. I appreciate having the opportunity to meet and speak with 
incredible femme engineers. Look out for my application when you‚Äôre looking for new grads in a couple months!</p>
