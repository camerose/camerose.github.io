About Me
Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Interdisciplinary Computer Science at Mills College in Oakland, California. I received my Bachelor's in Bioegnineering from UC San Diego, where I also worked as a wilderness guide for Outback Adventures.

I grew up in Aromas, a small town on the central coast of California.
