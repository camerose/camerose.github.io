		  I am a recent graduate from Mills College's Interdisciplinary Computer Science Master's program. Last summer (2019) I interned at LendUp, a mission-driven fintech company based in Oakland. I'm currently living near the Bay Area and looking for a full time software engineering positition, ideally in San Francisco or remote.
